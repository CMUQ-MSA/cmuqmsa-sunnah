A lightweight web application designed for the **CMU-Q Muslim Students Association**. This tool allows users to discover narrations from the six major books of Hadith and navigate through their respective chapters.

## 🌟 Features

* **Random Hadith Discovery:** Instantly fetches a random narration from major collections (Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi, Nasai).
* **Chapter Navigation:** Automatically detects the current chapter and allows users to read the "Previous" and "Next" Hadiths in that sequence.
* **Authenticity Grading:** Clearly displays the grade of each narration (e.g., *Sahih*, *Hasan*, *Da'if*) with color-coded indicators.
* **Sunnah Gold Theme:** Styled with a "Sunnah Gold" & Dark Charcoal palette for a classic, readable aesthetic.
* **Dual Script:** Uses *Amiri* for clear Arabic text and *Inter* for modern English translations.
* **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on mobile and desktop.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
* **API:** [Hadith-API by fawazahmed0](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/hadith-api) (Mirror of Sunnah.com)
* **Fonts:** [Amiri](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Amiri) (Arabic) & [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) (UI)

## 🚀 How to Run

Since this is a static web application, no backend server is required.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CMUQ-MSA/cmuqmsa-sunnah.git
    ```
2.  **Open the project:**
    Navigate to the folder and open `index.html` in your browser.

**VS Code Users:**
* Install the "Live Server" extension.
* Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".

## Production

Build the production container:

```bash
docker build -t cmuqmsa-sunnah .
```

The container serves static files on port **8080** inside the container. Use a reverse proxy in front for HTTPS and your public hostname.

Health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz
```

Runtime dependency: the browser fetches hadith data from the jsDelivr-hosted fawazahmed0 Hadith API snapshot. Container health only proves local static serving works; it does not prove the external data source is reachable.
